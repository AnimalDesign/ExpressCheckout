# Express Checkout

This module allows your customers to order without creating a customer account.

Well, in fact, a customer accou_nt is created, but your cutomers won't realize it.

*This is a work in progress*

The module is fully functionnal but is not suitable for all cases.
A configuration panel would be nice, to configure delivery and payment features.

Most ExpressCheckoutController code shoud be moved to an event listener.
